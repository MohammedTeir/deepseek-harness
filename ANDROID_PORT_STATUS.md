# Android Phase 0 and Phase 1 status

## Summary

Phase 0 is VERIFIED. Phase 1 audit artifacts are IMPLEMENTED and awaiting review; Gate 1 is not declared accepted. Phase 2 is NOT STARTED. This branch contains documentation and read-only audit tooling/data only. No Android app, runtime prototype, upstream workflow, frontend redesign or replacement agent is introduced. The prior local prototype is archived separately and supplies no Android acceptance evidence here.

## Upstream sync: Phase 1 evidence refreshed

The fork's upstream release `0.2.2-rc.2` is merged into this audit branch with both histories retained. The [sync impact record](audit/android/upstream-sync-impact.json) identifies the old and new revisions. The master specification is unchanged. Graphs, installed payloads, registry manifests and source indexes below now describe synced master, not the earlier release candidate. The former evidence remains in Git history.

The refresh reviews structured approval/cancellation errors, PTY load failures, credential masking, the new ripgrep/terminal/Office packages and the PTC evaluator's additional Node API. Native lock platform selection and terminal-bash defaults remain blockers. Neither the sync nor the audit starts Phase 2.

## Baseline and verification

[Exact baseline and environment](audit/android/baseline.json) records the current fork, included upstream baseline and observed upstream HEAD separately. The checkout started clean, `origin` points to the author's fork, `upstream` points to the original project, and `feature/android-port` was created from fork master before the author-synchronized source was merged. The author-synchronized upstream source is included; no separate upstream update was selected.

| Check | Executed result | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| `git status --short`, remotes, branches, log and `ls-remote` | Correct fork/remotes; clean start; baseline recorded | Remote observations are point-in-time |
| `python3 audit/android/collect.py` | 398 importers, 1,755 package identities, 1,763 snapshots, 8,836 edges; zero unresolved endpoints | Complete committed lock graph, not future dynamic downloads |
| Installed package scan | 1,426 identities; manifests/hooks/source descriptors/binary headers inspected | Linux installation; no Android execution |
| Repeated graph/index collection | Four recorded graph/index SHA-256 values reproduced exactly | Same installed tree and source baseline |
| Binary payload/ELF dependency graph | 161 inspected payload nodes and 211 DT_NEEDED edges | Loader resolution on Android remains unverified |
| Registry manifest fetch and integrity comparison | 329/329 retrieved, zero fetch errors, all distribution integrity values match lock | Archive bytes not downloaded or executed |
| `python3 audit/android/index_sources.py` | 37 Node builtin specifiers, 383 platform-sensitive sites, 17 native source/matrix paths | Static references include different product/build roles |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | PASS, 21.6 seconds; lockfile supply-chain policies passed for 1,755 entries | Host dependency installation only |
| `DSH_GATE_CONCURRENCY=2 pnpm run build` | PASS: 10 gates, 287.78 seconds; 369 client artifacts recorded | Host native addon, compilers, bundles, Web build and aggregate checks; no Android inference |
| `pnpm run lint` | PASS, with one existing unused-disable warning in client-ui-cot-translation | Host repository lint only |
| `pnpm run doc-sync` | 42 passed, one failed in 249.10 seconds | Only repository-reference gate: exact baseline hashes explicitly required by the author; checker unchanged |
| `pnpm run test:docs` | Initial refresh: 19 passed, two failed; registry metadata field selection corrected and `verify-concrete-terms` then passed | Full doc-sync subsequently passed the corrected metadata check; exact baseline hash gate remains |

## Blockers and recommendation

Node >=24.9 has no demonstrated supported Android runtime in this audit. Existing native lock selection rejects Android. node-pty's Linux ARM64 binary has GNU/Linux linkage, and the default persistent terminal assumes `/bin/bash` plus bash-specific control behavior. Android W^X, linker, app identity, PTY permissions and lifecycle must be qualified on devices. MCP stdio and arbitrary Node plugins can bypass a replacement central subprocess service; secure privilege mediation requires more than UI approval.

Recommend original Web UI plus the authentic profile/Cordis engine under a Kotlin supervisor, while comparing a source-built shared-library runtime with a compliant APK-packaged executable. JNI is a candidate, not a mandatory or verified decision. Preserve existing model/provider abstractions and service seams. Defer optional Termux/root, desktop-native plugins and broad package installation.

## Review boundary and next milestone

Review the [audit](ANDROID_PORT_AUDIT.md), [compatibility matrix](ANDROID_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md), [architecture](ANDROID_ARCHITECTURE.md), [security risks](ANDROID_SECURITY_MODEL.md) and [roadmap](ANDROID_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Noninstalled binary payloads, runtime-downloaded artifacts and Android execution remain unverified; these must not be represented as compatible.

After review only, the next milestone is an Android ARM64/API 29+ runtime qualification using real Node APIs and an authentic Harness profile: persistent session create/reopen, approved harmless command with actual stdout/stderr/exit, and denied-operation evidence. No Phase 2 implementation begins in this task. PR publication remains subject to the author's authorization.
